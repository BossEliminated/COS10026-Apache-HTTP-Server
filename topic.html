          <h2>What is apache?</h2>
          <p>Apache is an open source server application, it receives HTTP directory requests from users and sends them the information at that address. It can send files or handle reverse <a href="#PROXY_DEF">proxy requests.</a></p>
          <br>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Apache is non-copyleft open source and owned by the Apache Software Foundation. They are a nonprofit organisation and based in America. The group was established on March 25, 1999 today continuing to support a number of open source software projects. The origin of the Apache Project formed due to the slowly deprecating web server software "HTTP daemon" which was relied upon throughout the internet, and as a result the Apache project formed with the intention of creating a reliable web server software for public use. The original initiators of Apache were <em>Brian Behlendorf, Cliff Skolnick</em><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html#How"><sup>[0]</sup></a> with the software contributed to by a large array of developers the two gathered.</p>

          <p>Apache is used by a large majority amongst the internet, even when many open source options are available such as <strong class="tooltip_test">NGINX</strong> and <strong class="tooltip_test">Node.JS</strong></p>

              <p>Apache's release was received greatly, with it gaining popularity fast. Only near a year after release it had become one of the largest
              relied upon web server software in the realm of the internet. Only until around 10 years later did competitors start being used in a significant manner compared to Apache's large appeal to those looking for web server software.</p>

          <h3>The competitors to Apache</h3>
          <p>There are multiple other open source options available,however as TCP/IP protocols for communication are ideal for both users adhering to such protocols to communicate successfully, there are not many options that don't rely on the TCP/IP protocols due to their utilisation throughout the web. So the differences between the many similar technologies all differ in their stability, how and what data they store and security features however in essence both handle http requests and give replies back to clients.</p>
          <h3>The future of Apache</h3>
          <p>As Apache is maintained regularly, it appears to become a staple of web server technology and without reason of discontinuation as it is based on the layered protocols of TCP/IP which are utilised through the web, its usage is unlikely to ever drop off. The only threat to the use of Apache is its many competitors.</p>

          <p>Apache comes with a large amount of customisability, with further customisability provided by the use of <a href="#MODULES_DEF
          "><strong>modules</strong></a>. Modules can be added upon Apache for further commands and customisability to the software. Apache by itself comes with a standard suite of modules that allow users to for example: <em>waiting in response to information provided, specify IPs for further attention, utilisation of resources for processes.</em></p>
          <h3>The Core Component of Apache</h3>
          <p>Even with just its <strong>core</strong> component <strong>without any extra</strong> modules allows the user to manage their connections in a specific manner related to delays, limits, and what to accept and decline.</p>

          <p>Apache's core is based on its fundamental purpose being its web server functionality. Fundamentally handling the requests and providing content to those who request it. Importantly Apache utilises TCP/IP protocol to ensure packets arrive</p>
          <h3>Versions of Apache</h3>
          <p>Apache is a software with a long past, resulting in many versions of Apache available for use. Whilst documentation is available a small amount of old versions of Apache, with any set of software the arrival of new features and security patches emphasises a strong recommendation that latest versions are utilised. The current latest version of Apache recommended is <strong>2.4</strong> as of 14/03/2022.</p>
          <h3>Downloading Apache</h3>
          <p>Apache allows users to easily download the software, and access many of the older versions of Apache. The methods of downloading for each operating system differs, however each Operating System may result in a slightly different process when downloading Apache, with the favoured OS being linux with files provided in linux file format.</p>
